Command line tools for [fastify](https://github.com/mcollina/fastify).
Generate, write and run an application with one single command!

## Install
```bash
npm install fastify-cli --global
```

## Usage

`fastify-cli` offers a single command line interface for your fastify
project:

```bash
$ fastify
```

Will print an help:

```
fastify command line interface, available commands are:

  * start       start a server
  * generate    generate a new project
  * version     the current fastify-cli version
  * help        help about commands

Launch 'fastify help [command]' to know more about the commands.

The default command is start, you can hit

  fastify start plugin.js

to start plugin.js.
```

### start

You can start any fastify plugin with:

```bash
$ fastify start plugin.js
```

A plugin can be as simple as:

```js
// plugin.js
module.exports = function (fastify, options, next) {
  fastify.get('/', function (req, reply) {
    reply.send({ hello: 'world' })
  })
  next()
}
```

If you are using Node 8+, you can use `async` functions too:

```js
// async-await-plugin.js
module.exports = async function (fastify, options) {
  fastify.get('/', async function (req, reply) {
    return { hello: 'world' }
  })
}
```

See all the flags you can pass to `fastify start`, see the help: `fastify help start`.

If you want to use custom options, just export an options object with your route and run the cli command with the `--options` flag.

```js
// plugin.js
module.exports = function (fastify, options, next) {
  fastify.get('/', function (req, reply) {
    reply.send({ hello: 'world' })
  })
  next()
}

module.exports.options = {
  https: {
    key: 'key',
    cert: 'cert'
  }
}
```

#### fastify version discovery

If fastify has been installed local to plugin.js that copy will be used instead of the global copy included with fastify-cli.

### generate

`fastify-cli` can also help with generating some project scaffolding to
kickstart the development of your next fastify application. To use it:

1. `mkdir yourapp`
2. `cd yourapp`
3. `npm init`
4. `fastify generate`
5. `npm install`

The sample code offers you three npm tasks:

* `npm start` - starts the application
* `npm run colada` - starts the application with
  [`pino-colada`](https://github.com/lrlna/pino-colada) pretty logging,
not suitable for production
* `npm test` - runs the tests
